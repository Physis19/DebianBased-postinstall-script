# Debian Based Post-Install Script

Just a small post-installation script for Debian-based distros, with essential packages for my workflow

## Installation
Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Physis19/DebianBased-postinstall-script.git
```
## Usage
To run the script you need to allow it to run with 
```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```
After that, run the script using 
```bash
./main.sh
```
If you don't have the flatpak installed, the script will allow the installation before proceeding
